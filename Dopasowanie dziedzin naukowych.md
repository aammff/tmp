please find a good match for: informatyka, elektronika, biologia, lingwistyka; assuming that: chemia is a good match for matematyka, and fizyka is a good match for estetyka

[Dopasowanie dziedzin naukowych]

To find good matches for **informatyka (computer science)**, **elektronika (electronics)**, **biologia (biology)**, and **lingwistyka (linguistics)**, based on your analogical structure (e.g., **chemia** matches **matematyka** and **fizyka** matches **estetyka**), we can think about conceptual or interdisciplinary connections. Here's a proposal:

1. **Informatyka** ↔ **logika**  
   Justification: Computer science heavily relies on logical principles, algorithms, and formal systems.

2. **Elektronika** ↔ **mechanika**  
   Justification: Electronics is deeply intertwined with mechanics in fields like mechatronics and robotics.

3. **Biologia** ↔ **psychologia**  
   Justification: Biology connects to psychology through neuroscience and the study of living systems, including behavior.

4. **Lingwistyka** ↔ **semiotyka**  
   Justification: Linguistics and semiotics both study signs, meaning, and communication systems.

Would you like adjustments to these matches or explanations for the given analogies?
