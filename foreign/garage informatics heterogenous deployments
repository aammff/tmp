garage informatics heterogenous deployments

well known amer companies well their early days seen to be

or perhaps can be more easily remembered as fun ones

I am not much of a believer of homogenous in homogenous deployments

large small modern informatics seems to me only possible and safe with open source and open hardware especially m for mission critical systems
