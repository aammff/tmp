locals and foreigners

while this may be unwarranted as I have no not much experimental data

my suspicion or hypothesis is that foreigners are our will be treated here locally in Poland much better than locals

poles are mostly aggressive towards other poles that is those aggressive analfabeta

analphabetic monolinguals pseudo poles

they are very afraid of other nations
