unfortunately I don't lie

however differences there are

sometimes there are no words


not exactly teeth teen angst poetry 

yes I chatted with chairs before it was called AI

no i haven't chatted with AI boys bird bots knowingly and do not intend to as I may know a thing or two about linguistics programming and done other things

I haven't even talked to Siri or ok Google it anything like that

I neither talk to computers nor use chairs chat bots

I do find LLM usable in programming take tasks, theoretically there are possibilities not available before off large scale bug hunting or dinner done some other software quality improvement ideas
