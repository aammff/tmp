game rating scales


top secret had an interesting game rating scale differing   v ww wildly   for from the more common percanteg percentage more common on wikipedia


for for four variables

graphics   zero to nine afairc
sound zero to nine
thinking requirements or brainyness how much thinking expected i or required in this games zero to nine
  so obviously it is not that low thinking r game requirements are any worse this was an inv informative diversion
  fro from other parameters which normally would be expected to be high though sometimes it was allright for a game to have no music at all or only simple graphics
overall game coolness greatness  zero to nine

ther eis this word they usd th used the word miodnosc  as connected with honey  but  more general word could be fajnosc  which is not food related but brings c possitive connot 

fajnosc is not very serious  and is selto sle seldom used is not professional     miodnosc i s even less used  

it may seem it ise connected with g english fine   but it is something like cool or great  but with no  but not necesserily big or anything like that could be small

games described were obviously mostly foreign  though local games were also present  though thought though not avaialble in such quantities as foreign ones
