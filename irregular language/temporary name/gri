gri

not sure how flawed my intuition slash inference is but personal safety or climbing devices resembling gri gri which is not

sie side neutral that is  the device is more much more compatible with right handedness

which are not side neutral   may be a hidden cause of accidents 

i 

it may be best not to constuct invent use devices that 


i used to climb with the second version marked with the fre green dot sticker   had no accident a everything was allright  neverthelles  

would prefer side neutral gri version


as for the name of the device   well  i do not have a general solution for naming problems which are very common in it not sure what to do


[p


possibly unnecessary symmetry breaking and its effect on mental caches as experinced in semi automatic climbing activities


some notes

even simple non semiautmatic devices sometimes have some symmetry breaking features or cannot be used sy in a symmetry breaking free manner 

semit semiautomatic devies i believe to ince increase safety as i personally had an accident of a  qui question mark  small flying insect m biting me in the back of the neck

causing rope non planned rope freeing



side remark

many many years ago when i was extremely inexperienced so not really a mountaineer i us travelled through some via ferratas in itale using mostly or only st bolted steel chains that is

instead of avoiding those steel chains and trying to only touch and use rock features to ascend climb upwords i actively only used the steel chained chain blo sttel steel chain bolted 

and avoid touching the rocks not sure how many kilometers of upwords ways
