gri

not sure how flawed my intuition slash inference is but personal safety or climbing devices resembling gri gri which is not

sie side neutral that is  the device is more much more compatible with right handedness

which are not side neutral   may be a hidden cause of accidents 

i 

it may be best not to constuct invent use devices that 


i used to climb with the second version marked with the fre green dot sticker   had no accident a everything was allright  neverthelles  

would prefer side neutral gri version


as for the name of the device   well  i do not have a general solution for naming problems which are very common in it not sure what to do


[p


possibly unnecessary symmetry breaking and its effect on mental caches as experinced in semi automatic climbing activities
