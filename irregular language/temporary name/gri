gri

not sure how flawed my intuition slash inference is but personal safety or climbing devices resembling gri gri which is not

sie side neutral that is  the device is more much more compatible with right handedness

which are not side neutral   may be a hidden cause of accidents 

i 

it may be best not to constuct invent use devices that 


i used to climb with the second version marked with the fre green dot sticker   had no accident a everything was allright  neverthelles  

would prefer side neutral gri version


as for the name of the device   well  i do not have a general solution for naming problems which are very common in it not sure what to do


[p


possibly unnecessary symmetry breaking and its effect on mental caches as experinced in semi automatic climbing activities


some notes

even simple non semiautmatic devices sometimes have some symmetry breaking features or cannot be used sy in a symmetry breaking free manner 

semit semiautomatic devies i believe to ince increase safety as i personally had an accident of a  qui question mark  small flying insect m biting me in the back of the neck

causing rope non planned rope freeing



side remark

many many years ago when i was extremely inexperienced so not really a mountaineer i us travelled through some via ferratas in itale using mostly or only st bolted steel chains that is

instead of avoiding those steel chains and trying to only touch and use rock features to ascend climb upwords i actively only used the steel chained chain blo sttel steel chain bolted 

and avoid touching the rocks not sure how many kilometers of upwords ways 



another side remark

i remember controveris controversial controversises regarding  trekking climbing log books requirements   that is should mountain expeditions be forcefully logged in logbooks

wo so after many years the answer is pretty obvious no one should be forced to be put in the same book with anybody nor s no one should be forced to use a particular book paper

writing ex q equipment t etc especially in safety critical enviroments

i find the 


as for the illegal practice of robbing tourists masquarading as ticket national park sales      this is clearly incompatible with norther countries right to roam and soon

money should not be used for traffic shaping and limiting purposes in places considered sacred


how safe is rock climbing

was interested in this qui question looked up some statistics and came to the conclusion p approximate conclusion that it is about th as safe as care car travel to the crag

and more safe than skiing

i would participate in skiing when i was climbing therfore i considered climbing relatively doaable for persons who take irregular car travels

however p for mental safety bouldering seems to be much better  though n

i had only one serious accident in rocks and no accidents while skiing   the one i had e was when i was extremely inexperienced  the error was very common  inappropriate fir r first ring spit use

that it the first ring spit was too close to the ground
