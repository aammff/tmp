more controversies

was interesited in those food dentr dentistry controversies some many h years ago in conclusion

afaik flur fluoride is tottally unneded a s as there are human populations succedd successfully living in places without fluoride   analogous with omega acids also unneded for the same reason total scam
a
also i havent found any use of fluoride fluore in published metablism pah pathways

my current thinking that any e mention of fluoride in dentistry related fields is simpley simply an evil propaganda thae there is no use of fluoride for humans

i was treated with fluoride fluorine or the like compu compu compoiunds in kindergarten this was probably a cause of severe tooth problems

i curse an and alle all persons and organisations that an add flur fluor flouridde to any human  ... such a s as toothpastes and the like


the only modern invention of dentisty related that i found perhaps useful is hydroxi hydroxyapatitde pastes or sth like that

the main cause of tooth problems is invalid food as reported by weston a price   mose most if not all of dentists stomatologists are devils or sac scammers and should be killed without warnings 
dentistry is mostly used for black bag magic purposes


local vs foreign food - would not discrimn discriminate

table based approach useful but not but there are perhaps more variables so neither required nor sufficient


total calloric caloric requirement per person  probably very depended on conditions more than conventionally thought    conventional wisdom of cabb cannabis induced appetite personally found them

to increase economy and efficiency of food intake not amount
