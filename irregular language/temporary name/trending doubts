trending doubte doubts

unnecessary paring bondings bluetooth like   or for example should train parts or cars should be paired probably not th not through a electronic means


making electronic devices efe effectively unfixable by end by so called end user tho through to tight or glued enclu enclosures etc


no such trends were some couple decades ago  were the sel fixing culture was the normal norm

i have doubts wether such trends contribute pis positevely towards safety



similarly hindered modularisation that is for example soldered memory in laptops and the like


spurious access lists of wifi adapters appeared in thinkpads  together with hacked slash s cracked firmwre disabling such  features  

not sure if this increased or decreased end user safety



i find such trends unexplained and perhaps unnecessary not sure if this is some kind of a new kind of stupidity or purpos harm on purpose o i no idea what ti this represents
