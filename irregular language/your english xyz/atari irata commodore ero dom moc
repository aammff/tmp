atari irata commodore ero dom moc

found periphery peripheryial device info on wikipedia re atari and commodore lots of lots lots lots of hardware

so why exactly atari was that often criticised mercilessly why oh why


one res reado reason could timing availibity of turbo systems or for cassette tape drives 

so it happended taht commodore was very often already avialalble with such systems they arrived to atari some time later or

such is a local reception

though three sound channels seem a little strange t number compared to stander amiga like atari four


there was one or th two atari songs as amiga modules no such rememberance of commodore
