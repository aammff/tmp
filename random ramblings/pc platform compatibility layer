pc platform compatibility layer

it used to be that pc had bios a small library of os like functions giving basic access to display block devices 

though fs file systems were not implemented thus a pc resembled amiga booting did not turning powoe power on did

no not result in a usable user experience unless a drive was aa attached with a bootable medium though it was

also popular and easy to setup a network adapter card bott booting as a thin client through well network card bioses were advanced


originally iirc pc was i distributed fir with a so called ms dos operating system interesting history avaiable elsewhere

nowadays an they opensourced idk version four or sth also a freedos is also avaialble so it is possible to run an opensource dos a compatible system

what was dos as it was used well almost the same was avia avaiable as a dos software and drivers as is or was in early linux on the kernel side

so was it an unix system was dos a unix system  surely it resembles early uni t maybe not surely one can thin k  though ipc are di implemented 


in a different style mostly based on convenctions and os hooking cooperative os hooking perhaps some resemblance to the amiga programming model

mmuless machines  so in a way linux is a nextgen dos this is were fun went or continued in a way  it is possible or was to run early linux kernels

from dos through the loadlin program perhaps current kernel versions can still be run this was this way   a powerful suite is ala also avaialble on

linux emau emulating or directly accessing pchardware t so linux can run as a dos host or dos passthrough in a way


it should be possible to generate dos coma compatible hardware drivers from linux or it should even be possible to compile linux to a dos compatible dy system

as it is possible to dynticks tickless etc etc    actually lilo was an early popular boot manager for linux  however more advanced grub with dos like functionality

for example filesystem browsing was er very helpful thus gained popularity   probably a demolike multiboot example partition containing most popular minimal version

of ba various opensource operating system with a simple demo or game could be va a very fun and usable addition to multiboot menus  thoughts pe possibly stemming from the grub invaders toy game
