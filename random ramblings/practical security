practical security

some years ago the following methods were used in it  or programming environments environments were programmers program well program write their codes their things


plain old standard passwords  nothing special

ssh keys  that is pub assymetric crypto  standard thing since the openssh days w  there were times were telnet 

gpg keys  less common but  i guess still valid



lately not lately https 


i dislike two ef a  or any tech that is not easily scripted  i have enough  of typing retyping copying email contents onto random forms this is plain old stupitity stupidity

as for the i marketing droids inventions of passkeys and the like well    not sure tried red reading avaiable info and found them incomprehensible  not sure if the tech itself is any better than passs/ssh/gpg or anything 


as for the real security including  clandestine linguist lingus l pseudo lingus linguists   as my physical security was severly  well i was raped and my possesions were stolen a i am not really that interested in mathematical aspet aspects of seciru

seci security anymore  added to that the intel mag management and intel buggy processors this all makes for a bad 

just yesterday some info tool reported that some firmware is buggy on the laptop  the upr upf updated firmware sized  many many megabytes  firmware 

well i do not think that total firmware size should be any greater than hundreds of kilobytes sorry


i was not evan evan even able to boot the thing   earlier files were ok from this hardware vendor h not sure not sure not sure

blah

sorry for the marketing t droids maybe its good tech not sure have not found any good sources comp blah
